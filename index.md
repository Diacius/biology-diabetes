# Diabetes 

Diabetes is a condition that causes your blood sugar levels to become too high.

There are two types of diabetes:
  - [Type 1](#type-1-diabetes), which is a lifelong condition where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas which produce **insulin**.
  - [Type 2](#type-2-diabetes), which is where the body doesn't produce enough insulin or when the body's cells don't react to **insulin** correctly.

Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. 
In the UK 90% of adults with diabetes have type 2 diabetes.

# What is insulin?

Insulin is a hormone made in the pancreas that helps your body use glucose *(sugar)*.
If someone has type 1 diabetes then their pancreas no longer makes insulin, so they have to give their body [insulin](#what-is-insulin) by injecting it, which stabilizes the levels of glucose in their blood.

There are two situations in which type 1 diabetic people take insulin, *the insulin taken in both situations is the same* but it is taken for different reasons

## Basal (long acting or background) insulin

This is taken once or twice a day and is sometimes called long acting insulin.
This gives the person's body the insulin it needs for the day, whether or not glucose enters the body by eating food or drinking drinks with sugar in them.

## Bolus (fast acting or mealtime) insulin

Taking insulin at mealtimes or after a snack helps reduce the rise of glucse *(sugar)* in the blood that happens when you eat or drink.
The level of sugar in your blood increases when you eat because your body breaks down the carbohydrates in your food into sugar so that they can be used for energy.

# Type 1 diabetes

Type 1 diabetes happens when your body cannot enough of the hormone [insulin](#what-is-insulin) which controls the levels of glucose
